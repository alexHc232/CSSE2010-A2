This is the second assignment for CSSE2010, Introduction to computer systems, from semester 1 2025. It focussed more on the actual computer hardware and microcontrollers and I learnt C for the first time. We used this to make this elevator simulation for an LED board, which would display the animation and make sounds when the doors opened, you could add passengers and it would pick them up and take them to the desired floor, change the speed, etc.
